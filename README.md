# rank.me
A Tinder Inspired Application for Ranking the Women on cagedladies.com.  

This is just the working prototype for a social media app similar to "Hot or Not" or "Tinder".

# Objective

Display two images for the user who then chooses on of the images based on their preference.  The choice is recorded and timestamped while the selection adds weights to both of the items displayed

# Software

This application runs exclusively with PowerShell utilizing windows forms for the GUI, and powershell CSV cmlets for the "database" operation.  

# Use

To use the function you need to download the repository, unzip "images.zip" as just "images" within the same directory, and run jailrate.ps1.
